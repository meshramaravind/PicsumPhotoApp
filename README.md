# Build With

- [Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin) - Kotlin is a programming language that can run on JVM. Google has announced Kotlin as one of its officially supported programming languages in Android Studio; and the Android community is migrating at a pace from Java to Kotlin.
 
- [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx.html) - Android KTX is a set of Kotlin extensions that are included with Android Jetpack and other Android libraries. KTX extensions provide concise, idiomatic Kotlin to Jetpack, Android platform, and other APIs.

- [Android View Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - View binding is a feature that allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views. Once view binding is enabled in a module, it generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module. An instance of a binding class contains direct references to all views that have an ID in the corresponding layout.

- [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) - To handle app navigation.

- [Model-View-ViewModel(MVVM)](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) - Offers an implementation of observer design pattern.

- [Dagger Hilt) ](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - It is arguably the most used Dependency Injection, or DI, framework for Android. Many Android projects use Dagger to simplify building and providing dependencies across the app. It gives you the ability to create specific scopes, modules, and components, where each forms a piece of a puzzle: The dependency graph.
Clean Architecture - Applying Clean Architecture and Solid Principles to build a robust, maintainable, and testable application.

- [Retrofit)](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.Retrofit is a REST client for Java/ Kotlin and Android by Square inc under Apache 2.0 license. Its a simple network library that is used for network transactions. By using this library we can seamlessly capture JSON response from web service/web API.

- [Kotlin Coroutine](https://developer.android.com/kotlin) - A concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.

- [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - Lifecycle-aware components perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component, such as activities and fragments. These components help you produce better-organized, and often lighter-weight code, that is easier to maintain.

- [GSON](https://github.com/square/gson) - JSON Parser,used to parse requests on the data layer for Entities and understands Kotlin non-nullable and default parameters.

- [Kotlin Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) - In coroutines, a flow is a type that can emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to suspend functions that return only a single value.

- [Room DB](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) - To manage SQLite database easily and avoid a lot boilerplate code.The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.

- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - It is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.

- [Paging 3 with RemoteMediator for smooth infinite scroll](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview) - The Paging library helps you load and display pages of data from a larger dataset from local storage or over network. This approach allows your app to use both network bandwidth and system resources more efficiently.

- [Custom fileprovider](https://developer.android.com/training/secure-file-sharing/setup-sharing) - Custom fileprovider for writing & reading files into internal storage. 

- [Swipe Refresh](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/touch-and-input/swipe) - Swipe Refresh Layout for pull-to-refresh RecyclerView.

- [Photo View](https://github.com/Baseflow/PhotoView) - Photo View for zoom in/out image.

- [Timber](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - It helps in logging while debugging your app. and all logging code will not be embedded in the released APK.

- [Clean Architecture](https://www.kodeco.com/3595916-clean-architecture-tutorial-for-android-getting-started) - Applying Clean Architecture and Solid Principles to build a robust, maintainable, and testable application.
